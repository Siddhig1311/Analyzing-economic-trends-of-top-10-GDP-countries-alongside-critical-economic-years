## Project Overview

The analysis highlights critical economic trends, including:
- Real GDP growth over time.
- Labor productivity by country and year.
- Contributors to growth (capital, labor, and Total Factor Productivity).
- Price level comparisons between countries.
- Statistical capacity indicators across nations.

## Dataset Description

The Penn World Table (PWT) is a comprehensive global macroeconomic dataset. Key variables include:
- **Real GDP per capita**: Inflation-adjusted economic output.
- **Labor productivity**: Economic output per labor unit.
- **Statistical capacity**: Quality and availability of economic data.

These variables enable cross-country analysis and visualization of global economic systems.

## Visualizations

1. **Real GDP Over Time**:
   - Line chart showing GDP trends across countries.
   - Highlights economic booms, stagnations, and recessions.

2. **Labor Productivity**:
   - Bar chart depicting productivity levels by country and year.
   - Comparison of technological adoption and efficiency.

3. **Growth Contributors**:
   - Treemap visualizing the impact of capital, labor, and TFP on growth.

4. **Price Levels**:
   - Bar chart comparing relative price levels across nations.

5. **Statistical Capacity Indicator**:
   - Choropleth map displaying countries' statistical data quality.

## Insights and Key Takeaways

- **Economic Growth**: Developed economies grow steadily, while emerging economies like China show exponential growth.
- **Productivity**: Labor productivity is a key differentiator between developed and developing countries.
- **Global Inequality**: Price levels and statistical capacity reveal disparities in economic infrastructure and living standards.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **Dataset**: Penn World Table (PWT)
- **Visualization Tool**: Tableau
- **Analysis Framework**: Statistical and economic analysis methods

## How to Run the Project

1. **Prepare the Data**:
   - Import the PWT dataset into Tableau.
   - Clean and preprocess the data as described in the `data_processing.md` file.

2. **Generate Visualizations**:
   - Open Tableau and connect to the prepared dataset.
   - Use predefined templates or follow the steps in the `visualization_steps.md` file.

3. **Interactive Dashboard**:
   - Combine the visualizations into a dashboard.
   - Use filters and interactive elements for customized analysis.
